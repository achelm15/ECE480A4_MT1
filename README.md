# ECE480A4_MT1 - SAT Solver
To run the base program enter:
`python run.py "boolean function"`
- The boolean function must use variables in the form xN, with N being the Nth number. The first variable must be x1. x0 cannot be used.
- The boolean function must be in SoP form

## TODO
- Determine correctness of CNF file maker

- Determine correctness of use input set functionality

- "Your SAT solver should be able to find and report the smallest set of input variables with their values"

- "Your SAT solver should be able to take in the input two different functions and then find input variables that can cause the two functions to be unequal"
